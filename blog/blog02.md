## Product Design

| Field           | Description                   |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Player Experience and Game POV         | The game is experienced through a **first-person perspective**, within a hallway/house setting that subtly transforms across three distinct phases—from utopia through glitches, culminating in dystopia.                 |
| Visual and Audio Style | Magical and surreal — vibrant colors, glowing elements, and atmospheric sounds with soft magical chimes. As the player progresses, the environment gradually shifts to a more realistic setting with muted tones and subtle visual glitches, accompanied by darker, more haunting music to reflect the growing tension and awareness. |
| Game World Fiction | Players awaken in an idyllic virtual setting unaware that their consciousness has been digitized. And will later progress to a glitched reality and a chaotic dystopia, as their awareness of the reality of their existence gradually increases|
| Platform(s), Technology, and Scope (brief) | PC and Arcade, 3D using Unity Editor, created with a focus on exploration, mystery, and puzzle-solving. |

## Detailed & Game Systems Design

| Field           | Description                   |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Core Loops | The player will explore the shifting environment, solve puzzles, and collect fragments of memory to understand the underlying story. |
| Objectives and Progression | The player moves through three phases—utopia, glitch-reality, and dystopia—each gradually revealing the truth about their digital existence. Along the way, they encounter hidden symbols, corrupted files, and fragmented clues. In the final scene, the player accesses a terminal where they find a file representing themselves. If they attempt to delete it by dragging it to the trash, a pop-up appears asking for a password—one they’ve unknowingly been collecting clues for throughout the game. |
| Game Systems | - Exploration <br> - Puzzle-solving <br> - Dialogue and story choices <br> - Memory collection (to unlock backstory) |
| Interactivity | - The player can move in all directions using first-person controls <br> - Interact with objects <br> - Solve environmental puzzles to unlock new areas and memories |
