# Roll-A-Ball – With a Hidden Twist

For this small project, I built on top of Unity’s classic *Roll-A-Ball* tutorial. Most of the basic mechanics—like player movement, collecting pickups, and camera follow—were already handled in the tutorial. My task was to take that foundation and add something of my own. I knew I didn’t want to just tweak numbers or visuals. I wanted to add something that reflected the kinds of games I enjoy playing.

What I ended up doing was sneaking a secret into the game: a hidden level that exists *beneath* the main one. It’s not something you’ll stumble into easily. You actually have to abuse the game’s physics a little—jump over one of the outer walls by building up momentum and hitting it just right. It’s kind of a glitch, but a very intentional one.

The reason I added this hidden area is because I’ve always loved secrets and easter eggs in games. Whether it’s a hidden room, a breakable wall, or a weird out-of-bounds trick, there’s something really satisfying about discovering something the game doesn’t explicitly point you toward. It makes the world feel more alive—and makes the player feel clever.

Designing the hidden level was fun. It’s not big or complex, but it’s there for the curious. I added a few pickups down there to reward players who make the jump, and I adjusted the lighting and materials to make it feel visually distinct from the regular level. It’s a small touch, but it made the project feel like mine, even though most of the code and structure came from the tutorial.

Overall, this wasn’t a big or complicated game to make, but I learned a lot by modifying a simple base and adding something personal. It reminded me that even small design choices—like where you put a wall, or how you structure a level—can have a big impact on how people experience a game. And sometimes, the best part of a game is what you *don’t* expect to find.
