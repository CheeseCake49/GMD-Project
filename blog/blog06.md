# Conclusion
As we reflect on the completion of this project, we recognize that the final result is not exactly the game we originally set out to create. Our early ambitions were broader and more complex, and throughout the development process, we had to make tough decisions, cut features, and simplify ideas in order to meet our deadline and technical limitations we faced.

One of our biggest technical challenges was getting the game to work on the arcade machine setup. We struggled to get the camera controls to respond properly to the joystick input, and despite multiple attempts, we never got it to function correctly on the arcade machine. This was a major source of frustration, especially since arcade support is one of the requirements. However, we did manage to get full controller support working on an Xbox controller, so even though we don't 100% fulfill the requirement, the game is still fully playable with gamepad input, which we consider a solid compromise.

That said, weâ€™re proud of what we built: a playable, atmospheric experience with interactive puzzles and a strong narrative foundation. It may not fully reflect our original vision, but it stands as a functional and engaging prototype that we both learned a lot from.

Throughout the process we had a good sense of teamwork, supported each other through technical issues, and shared the workload well. That said, we also recognize that our communication could have been better at times especially in the early stages. We sometimes lacked motivation and struggled to get fully started, which delayed the progress and made it harder to reach our full potential. If we had maybe pushed each other more and motivade each other, the result might have come even closer to our original vision.

Still, this experience has taught us a lot not just about Unity, C#, animation, and UI design, but also about project planning, self-discipline, and collaboration. These lessons will definitely stay with us and influence how we approach future projects.
